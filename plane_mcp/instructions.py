## Epics

There are no epic tools — an epic is a work item whose type is named "Epic". Work
items always belong to a project; ask which if one is not named.
1. type = resolve_work_item_type(project_id, "Epic") — type.id is the type_id.
2. Create: create_work_item(project_id, type_id=type.id, name=...).
3. List: list_work_items(project_id) and filter returned `type_id` client-side.
4. Read / update / delete / nest: retrieve_work_item / update_work_item /
   delete_work_item by work item id (set parent=<work item id> to nest).
5. List an epic's children: list_work_items(project_id) and filter returned `parent` client-side.
